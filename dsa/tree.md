## ðŸŒ³ Tree Problem Patterns

We'll focus on the following patterns:

1. **Traversal Techniques**: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level Order
2. **Recursive Tree Problems**: Depth, Height, Diameter, Balanced Trees
3. **Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations**: Insertion, Deletion, Validation
4. **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)**
5. **Tree Construction**: From Traversals, Arrays
6. **Path-Related Problems**: Path Sum, Maximum Path
7. **Serialization & Deserialization**
8. **View-Based Problems**: Top View, Bottom View, Right View, Left View
9. **Advanced Topics**: Morris Traversal, Threaded Binary Trees
