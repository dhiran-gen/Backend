Alright, since today’s task is to read **Chapters 1-2** of *Grokking the System Design Interview*, I'll guide you through the key concepts, explanations, and practical takeaways.

### **📌 Chapters 1-2 Breakdown**
### **📖 Chapter 1: What is System Design?**
**Key Takeaways:**
1. **System Design vs. Coding**  
   - Coding problems have a single correct answer, but system design problems have multiple valid solutions.
   - System design is about designing scalable, reliable, and maintainable systems.

2. **Why System Design is Important?**  
   - When applications scale, simple architectures fail due to load, latency, and consistency issues.
   - Real-world applications must handle millions of requests per second efficiently.

3. **Basic Non-Functional Requirements** (These determine how well a system performs)  
   - **Scalability:** Can the system handle increasing users?
   - **Reliability:** Does the system stay functional despite failures?
   - **Availability:** What % of time is the system available? (e.g., 99.99% uptime)
   - **Maintainability:** Can engineers update it easily?

### **📖 Chapter 2: Key System Design Concepts**
Now, we get into real technical components.  

🔹 **1. Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling**
   - **Vertical Scaling (Scale-Up):** Increase CPU/RAM in a single machine. 🚀 (Limited by hardware)
   - **Horizontal Scaling (Scale-Out):** Add more machines to distribute the load. 🌍 (Preferred for large systems)

🔹 **2. Load Balancing**
   - Distributes traffic across multiple servers to avoid overloading.
   - Examples: **Round Robin, Least Connections, IP Hashing**
   - Load Balancers:
     - **Layer 4 LB (TCP/UDP)** → Fast, works at transport layer.
     - **Layer 7 LB (HTTP/HTTPS)** → Smarter, can route based on URL, cookies, etc.

🔹 **3. Caching**
   - **Purpose:** Reduce database load, improve response time.
   - **Types:**
     - **Client-side cache** (e.g., Browser cache)
     - **CDN (Content Delivery Network)** – Stores static assets close to users.
     - **Database cache** (e.g., Redis, Memcached)
   - **Cache Invalidation Strategies:**
     - **Write-through:** Update cache & DB simultaneously.
     - **Write-back:** Update cache first, then DB (risk of data loss).

🔹 **4. Database Scaling**
   - **Sharding:** Splitting a large database into smaller partitions.
   - **Replication:** Keeping multiple copies of data for redundancy.

🔹 **5. CAP Theorem**
   - A distributed system can have only 2 out of 3:
     - **Consistency:** All nodes see the same data.
     - **Availability:** System is always up.
     - **Partition Tolerance:** Works even if network splits.

### **💻 Hands-on Practical Tasks**
You said you like learning by doing, so let’s apply these concepts:  

**🛠️ Task 1: Setup a Simple Load Balancer**
- **Tools:** Use **NGINX** or **HAProxy**
- Install Nginx:  
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx -y
  ```
- Configure a reverse proxy to distribute requests across two backend servers.

---

**🛠️ Task 2: Implement Caching with Redis**
- Install Redis:  
  ```bash
  sudo apt install redis -y
  ```
- Write a simple Golang API with Redis caching.

---

**🛠️ Task 3: Database Sharding Simulation**
- Use **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** to create **two database shards**.
- Write queries to store data across different shards.
