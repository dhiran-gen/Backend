## ðŸ§  System Design Mastery Roadmap (25-Year Architect Level)

### **ðŸ“˜ Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Scalable System Design**

* Principles: Reliability, Scalability, Maintainability, Cost, and Performance
* Load Handling: QPS, Latency, Throughput, SLA/SLO
* Network Protocols: TCP, HTTP/2, gRPC, WebSocket
* Exercise: Define QPS and latency goals for a mock product (e.g., Twitter clone)

---

### **ðŸ“˜ Chapter 2: API Design and Backend Contracts**

* REST vs gRPC vs GraphQL
* API Versioning, Pagination, Rate Limiting
* Design Consistent Error Handling
* Exercise: Design the public API for a food delivery system (Swiggy-like)

---

### **ðŸ“˜ Chapter 3: Storage Layer Design**

* SQL vs NoSQL vs NewSQL
* Indexing, Partitioning, Sharding, CAP theorem
* Caching strategies: Write-through, write-back, TTLs
* Exercise: Model the DB schema for Spotify + Query patterns

---

### **ðŸ“˜ Chapter 4: Scaling Patterns**

* Load Balancing: L4 vs L7, sticky sessions
* Horizontal scaling vs Vertical scaling
* Stateless services + session management
* Exercise: Design a multi-node URL shortener with 10M+ users

---

### **ðŸ“˜ Chapter 5: Distributed Systems Basics**

* Consensus: Raft, Paxos, ZAB
* Leader election, heartbeats, quorum
* Clock sync: NTP, Logical vs Physical clocks
* Exercise: Design a distributed lock manager like etcd/Consul

---

### **ðŸ“˜ Chapter 6: Asynchronous Processing**

* Message queues: Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS
* Pub/Sub, Event Sourcing, CQRS
* Dead-letter queues, retry mechanisms
* Exercise: Design an order processing pipeline for Swiggy

---

### **ðŸ“˜ Chapter 7: Caching Systems & CDN**

* Redis, Memcached, CDN edge caching
* Cache eviction policies: LRU, LFU, TTL, write-through
* CDN: Akamai, Cloudflare, Netflix Open Connect
* Exercise: CDN strategy for Netflix or YouTube streaming

---

### **ðŸ“˜ Chapter 8: Authentication & Authorization**

* OAuth2, OpenID Connect, JWT, SSO, RBAC/ABAC
* Secure session management
* Multi-tenant identity patterns
* Exercise: Design auth for an eCommerce platform with admin/user roles

---

### **ðŸ“˜ Chapter 9: Observability**

* Metrics, Logs, Traces (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)
* Health checks, structured logging, alerting thresholds
* Chaos testing & failure injection
* Exercise: Design a dashboard to monitor latency and errors in Uber

---

### **ðŸ“˜ Chapter 10: Cloud Architecture Patterns**

* Microservices, Serverless, Monoliths, Sidecars
* Kubernetes basics: Pods, Services, Ingress, HPA
* IaC: Terraform, Helm
* Exercise: Design deployment & autoscaling for Google Maps backend

---

### **ðŸ“˜ Chapter 11: Advanced Architecture Patterns**

* API Gateway, Service Mesh, Circuit Breakers, Bulkheads
* Backpressure, Token Buckets, Rate Limiting
* Distributed Tracing, Correlation IDs
* Exercise: Build fault-tolerant streaming infra like Spotify wrapped

---

### **ðŸ“˜ Chapter 12: Real World Design Case Studies**

* **Uber**: Real-time dispatch & location tracking
* **Swiggy**: Order allocation, SLA routing
* **Spotify**: Personalized playlist generation + caching
* **Google Maps**: Route calculation, real-time traffic
* **YouTube**: Video upload, transcoding & CDN delivery

Each case study includes:

* Architecture diagrams
* Trade-offs
* Bottlenecks
* Scaling stories

---

## ðŸ’» Tooling Used Throughout

* Diagrams: [https://sequencediagram.org](https://sequencediagram.org), draw\.io
* Load Testing: Vegeta, k6
* Databases: PostgreSQL, Cassandra, Redis
* Message Brokers: Kafka, RabbitMQ
* Cloud/Containers: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform
* Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger

---

## ðŸ“… Learning Schedule Suggestion

* **3 chapters/week** (you choose your time slot)
* 1 mini-system per week to design + defend
* 1 major real-world system every 2â€“3 weeks
