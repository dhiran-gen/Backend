# Backend
senior backend engineer

Here's a detailed, hands-on 37-day plan (Feb 2 to Mar 10) that integrates theory, practical exercises, mini-projects, and reflection sessions. The schedule assumes you can dedicate around 5–7 hours daily split into your early-morning (5–10 am) and late-evening (9–11 pm) sessions. You can adjust specific time blocks as needed, but try to stick to the structure to cover all key topics for a senior backend engineer.

    Note: Each “Day” below is a focused module. Many days include reading theory (about 1–2 hours), whiteboard/design sessions (1 hour), hands-on coding (1.5–2 hours), and review/documentation (1–2 hours). Use recommended resources and tools provided below to make each session interactive and project-oriented.
